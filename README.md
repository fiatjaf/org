# rfae

rfae, the references application engine, is a javascript application template that can be used as it is as a simple multiuse CRUD app that automatically puts together related data, it is easy and fast and stores data at the browser itself (through PouchDB).

rfae can be incremented/modified to easily generate specific apps, with specific data models and specific modes of presentation of that data.

rfae can also sync the data from the browser to a CouchDB instance and vice-versa.
